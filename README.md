# eventually
an API that wraps the blaseball feed into a nice searchable index

[API docs here](https://alisww.github.io/eventually)

## now in rust
eventually has been re-written into rust!
the main code is also blaseball agnostic, and lives at [alisww/compass](https://github.com/alisww/compass)
the old api is still alive and will be for a while, for transition purposes and also because this rewrite is still in earlier stages of development.


## have suggestions, bug reports or questions?
feel free to ping me at `@sapphicfettucine#6248` in `#projects` in [SIBR](https://discord.sibr.dev)!
